## Added

- Best-effort `commitlint --from origin/main --to HEAD` check in `.husky/pre-push`
  ([A-982](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-982)), alongside the existing yamllint/actionlint steps. Skips with an
  installation hint when `@commitlint/cli` is missing, when `dist/index.js` is absent
  (this repo's config extends the built artefact; run `pnpm build` after clone/clean),
  or when `origin/main` is not a resolvable ref; bypassable with `git push --no-verify`.
  Complements CI's `reusable-validate-commits` gate rather than replacing it.
- Local `commitlint.config.mjs` that extends `./dist/index.js` so this package
  dogfoods its own ruleset (consumers still use `@acme-skunkworks/commitlint-config`).
- `@commitlint/cli` as a devDependency for the local range check.

## Changed

- Documented the pre-push commitlint dogfood path in `CLAUDE.md`.
