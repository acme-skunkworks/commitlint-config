## Changed

**Re-vendor shared agent-skills to source `main` ([A-1266](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1266))**

- Wipe + re-copy shared skill bundles on `.claude` and `.agents` from `acme-skunkworks/agent-skills`
- Restore per-skill `config.json` ([A-706](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-706)) and reconcile via `initialise-skills`
- Land `triage-pr` human-envelope / review-wait / `deferNonBlocking` and `send-it.triage` where those skills are installed
- Preserve repo-local skills; keep Linear identity `Rheged Studio` / `rheged-studio`
