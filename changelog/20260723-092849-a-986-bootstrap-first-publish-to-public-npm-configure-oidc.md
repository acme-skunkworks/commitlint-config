## Changed

- Seeded `package.json` and `.release-please-manifest.json` at `1.0.0`, the initial
  published version for the bootstrap first publish to public npm
  ([A-986](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-986)). The `1.0.0` tarball was
  published manually via the passkey/WebAuthn browser flow — npm has no
  pending-Trusted-Publisher flow and enforces interactive 2FA on the first publish of a
  new package, so publish #1 cannot go through CI. Seeding the manifest hands bump
  control to release-please from the next release onward.
- Normalised `repository.url` to the `git+https://` form, clearing the
  `npm warn publish "repository.url" was normalized` warning that surfaced on every
  publish.

This is a `chore` (no release): the `1.0.0` release itself was cut by the manual publish,
so the PR title must not signal release-please to bump on top of the version already live
on npm. From publish #2, releases flow through CI via OIDC Trusted Publishing once the
Trusted Publisher is configured and the Release workflow is enabled.
