## Changed

- Reset `changelog/` to just its `README.md`, dropping the 16 dated entries
  copied from `npm-package-template` so the post-merge enricher cannot stamp
  this package's first version onto the template's own history.
- Rewrote the `package.json` identity to `@acme-skunkworks/commitlint-config`
  with a real description, keywords, and repository/homepage/bugs URLs. The
  build, script, and dependency shell is unchanged, and `src/` still ships the
  template placeholder until the real commitlint config is authored.
- Pulled the locked shared agent-skills set into both the Claude Code and
  Cursor trees, generated each skill's resolved `config.json` from this repo's
  own facts (issue key `A`, base branch `main`, Linear team ACME Skunkworks,
  workspace `acme-skunkworks`), and recorded the versions in
  `.claude/skills.lock`.
- Applied the GitHub settings that "Use this template" does not copy: the
  `main`-restricted `npm-release` environment, the `GO/NO GO` required-check
  ruleset, and the `Trunk` changelog bypass for `road-runner-bot`.
