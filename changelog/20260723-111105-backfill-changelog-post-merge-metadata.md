## Changed

- Backfilled the post-merge metadata (`merged_at`, `pr`, `commit`, `stats`) on the
  four dated changelog entries for PRs #3, #4, #6 and #8. Those entries predate the
  release pipeline being enabled ([A-988](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-988)),
  so the post-merge enricher never ran, and the fields were left blank — this restores
  the backlog to a complete record. Values were filled from each merged PR's own facts
  via the changelog skill's enrichment logic; `version` is intentionally left unstamped
  (it is owned by release-please and filled at release time), and each entry's original
  frontmatter formatting is preserved so only the blank fields change.
